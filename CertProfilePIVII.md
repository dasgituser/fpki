1. Introduction 
================

This document specifies the X.509 version 3 certificate and version 2 certificate revocation list (CRL) profiles for certificates and CRLs issued for use with Personal Identity Verification Interoperable (PIV-I) cards. The profiles serve to identify unique parameter settings for certificates and CRLs issued for use with these cards.

This profile is based the X.509 Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Extensions Profile for the Shared Service Providers (SSP) Program \[13\], which is based on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) profile developed by the PKIX working group \[3\]. The PKIX profile identifies the format and semantics of certificates and CRLs for the Internet PKI. Procedures are described for processing and validating certification paths in the Internet environment. Encoding rules are provided for all fields and extensions profiled in both the X.509 v3 certificate and v2 CRL. Encoding rules for cryptographic algorithms specified in this profile are specified in \[7\] and \[10\].

 1.1. Structure 
----------------

This document is divided into six sections. Section 1 includes this introduction. Sections 2 and 3 describe the v3 certificate and v2 CRL respectively. These sections specifically describe the differences in generation and processing requirements between the PKIX profile and the profile for certificates and CRLs issued for PIV-I. Unless otherwise noted in this profile, the reader should follow the PKIX generation and processing requirements for a particular field. Section 4 specifies rules for choosing character encoding sets for attribute values of type DirectoryString in distinguished names. Section 5 profiles the use of uniform resource identifiers (URIs) in certificates. Section 6 highlights certificate contents that are particular to PIV-I. Section 7 provides an overview of each of the certificate and CRL profiles included in the worksheets corresponding to this document.

2. X.509 v3 Certificates 
=========================

X.509 v3 certificates contain the identity and attribute data of a subject using the base certificate with applicable extensions. The base certificate contains such information as the version number of the certificate, the certificate’s identifying serial number, the signature algorithm used to sign the certificate, the issuer’s distinguished name, the validity period of the certificate, the distinguished name of the subject, and information about the subject’s public key. To this base certificate are appended numerous certificate extensions. More detailed information about X.509 certificates can be found in Recommendation X.509 and RFC 5280.

CAs create certificates for user authentication procedures that require one user to obtain another user’s public key. So that users trust the public key, the CA employs a digital signature to cryptographically sign the certificate in order to provide assurance that the information within the certificate is correct. The fields in a certificate identify the issuer (i.e., CA), subject (i.e., user), version number, subject’s public key, validity period, and serial number of the certificate along with the public key algorithm used to certify the certificate. A CA may also add certificate extensions containing additional information about the user or the CA, depending on the implementation.

3. X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists 
=========================================

CAs use CRLs to publicize the revocation of a subject’s certificate. The CRLs are stored in the directory as attributes and are checked by relying parties to verify that a user’s certificate has not been revoked. The fields in a CRL identify the issuer, the date the current CRL was generated, the date by which the next CRL will be generated, and the revoked users’ certificates.

The CRLs issued to comply with the requirements of Section 4.9.7 of the FBCA \[1\] must be complete for scope: they may not be indirect CRLs, delta-CRLs, or CRLs segmented by reason code. CAs may optionally issue additional CRLs, such as delta-CRLs, so long as complete for scope CRLs are also made available and are issued with sufficient frequency to meet the requirements specified in Section 4.9.7 of the FBCA. CAs that issue segmented CRLs are strongly encouraged to also issue full CRLs in order to accommodate third parties that use CRLs to generate OCSP responses. CAs may optionally supplement the CRL based revocation mechanisms with on-line revocation mechanisms.

If delta-CRLs are issued, then either the certificates or the complete CRLs that correspond to the delta-CRLs should include a FreshestCRL extension that points to the delta-CRLs. If an OCSP server is available that provides status information about a certificate, then the authorityInfoAccess extension for that certificate should include a pointer to the OCSP server.

4. Encoding Distinguished Names with Attributes of type DirectoryString 
========================================================================

X.509 certificates and CRLs include distinguished names to identify issuers (of certificates and CRLs), subjects of certificates, and to specify CRL distribution points.

Many of the attributes in distinguished names use the DirectoryString syntax.

DirectoryString permits encoding of names in a choice of character sets: PrintableString, TeletexString, BMPString, UniversalString, and UTF8String.

PrintableString is currently the most widely used encoding for attribute values in distinguished names. PrintableString is a subset of ASCII; it does not include characters required for most international languages. UTF8String is an encoding that supports all recognized written languages, including some ancient languages (e.g., Runic). Any name that can be represented in PrintableString can also be encoded using UTF8String.

Name comparison is an important step in X.509 path validation, particularly for name chaining and name constraints computation. Many legacy implementations are unable to perform name comparisons when names are encoded using different character sets. To simplify correct operation of path validation, CAs are strongly encouraged to honor the subject’s chosen character set when issuing CA certificates or populating extensions. That is, if a subject CA encodes its own name in the issuer field of certificates and CRLs it generates using TeletexString, the cross certificate should use the same character set to specify that CA’s name.

Name constraints are specified in CA certificates. The names specified in name constraints must be compared with the subject names in subsequent certificates in a certification path. To help ensure that name constraints are applied correctly, CAs should encode each attribute value in a name constraint using the same encoding as is used to encode the corresponding attribute value in subject names in subsequent certificates. In general, it may be assumed that subject names are encoded in the same way as the issuer field in the certificates issued by the subject of the certificate containing the name constraints extension.

For certificates and CRLs issued for PIV-I, attributes of type DirectoryString shall be encoded in either PrintableString or UTF8String. Attribute values should be encoded in PrintableString whenever possible.

5. Use of URIs in Distribution Points, AuthorityInfoAccess, and subjectInfoAccess Extensions 
=============================================================================================

Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are used in four different extensions within the certificate and CRL profiles in this document: authorityInfoAccess, subjectInfoAccess, cRLDistributionPoints, and issuingDistributionPoint. Two different protocols are used in this document: LDAP and HTTP. The specifications for URIs for these protocols may be found in RFC 4516 and RFC 2616, respectively.

Except for the id-ad-ocsp access method of the authorityInfoAccess extension, the scheme portion of all URIs must be either "http" or "ldap" to indicate that the relevant information is located in an LDAP accessible directory or via HTTP. For the id-ad-ocsp access method of the authorityInfoAccess, the scheme portion of the URI must be "http" to indicate that the transport protocol for the OCSP request/response messages is HTTP. The hostname of every URI must be specified as either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address. The information must be made available via the default port number for the relevant protocol (80 for HTTP and 389 for LDAP) and so does not need to be specified in the URI.

In the cRLDistributionPoints extension, the URI is a pointer to a current CRL that provides status information about the certificate. If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN of the entry containing the CRL and specify the directory attribute in which the CRL is located (certificateRevocationList, authorityRevocationList, or deltaRevocationList). If the directory in which the CRL is stored expects the "binary" option to be specified, then the attribute type must be followed by ";binary" in the URI. If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file that has an extension of ".crl" that contains the DER encoded CRL (see RFC 2585). When a URI is used as the

DistributionPointName in the issuingDistributionPoint extension in a CRL, the value must match the URI in the corresponding distribution points in the cRLDistributionPoints extensions in certificates covered by the CRL.

Some examples of URIs that may appear in a cRLDistributionPoints or issuingDistributionPoint extension are:

http://www.example.com/fictitiousCRLdirectory/fictitiousCRL1.crl ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=Good%20CA,c=US?certificateRevocationList;binary

The authorityInfoAccess extension uses URIs for two purposes. When the id-adcaIssuers access method is used, the access location specifies where certificates issued to the issuer of the certificate may be found. If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN of the entry containing the relevant certificates and specify the directory attribute in which the certificates are located. If the directory in which the certificates are stored expects the "binary" option to be specified, then the attribute type must be followed by ";binary" in the URI. If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file that has an extension of ".p7c" that contains a certs-only CMS message (see RFC 5751). The CMS message should include all certificates issued to the issuer of this certificate, but must at least contain all certificates issued to the issuer of this certificate in which the subject public key may be used to verify the signature on this certificate.

Certificates issued for PIV-I must include an authorityInfoAccess extension that contains at least one instance of the id-ad-caIssuers access method. The access location for this instance must be an HTTP URI.

For a certificate issued by “Good CA”, some examples of URIs that may appear as the access location in an authorityInfoAccess extension when the id-ad-caIssuers access method is used are:

http://www.example.com/fictitiousCertsOnlyCMSdirectory/certsIssuedToGoodCA.p7c ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=Good%20CA,o=Test%20Certificates,c=US?cACertificate,crossCertificatePair; binary

When the id-ad-ocsp access method is used, the access location specifies the location of an OCSP server that provides status information about the certificate. The URI may include a path. Where privacy is a requirement, the URI may specify the "https" scheme to indicate that the transport protocol for OCSP requests/responses is HTTP over SSL/TLS. In this case, the default port number is 443, and the URI must include the server's port number if this default port number is not used.

The id-ad-caRepository access method for the subjectInfoAccess extension uses URIs to specify the location where CA certificates issued by the subject of the certificate may be found. If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN of the entry containing the relevant certificates and specify the directory attribute in which the certificates are located. If the directory in which the certificates are stored expects the "binary" option to be specified, then the attribute type must be followed by ";binary" in the URI. If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file that has an extension of ".p7c" that contain a certs-only CMS message (see RFC 5751). The CMS message should include all CA certificates issued by the subject of this certificate, but must at least contain all CA certificates issued by the subject of this certificate in which the signature on the certificate may be verified using the subject public key in this certificate.

CA certificates for PIV-I should include a subjectInfoAccess extension that contains at least one instance of the id-ad-caRepository access method. The access location for this instance should be an HTTP URI . If the subject of the certificate only issues end entity certificates, then the subjectInfoAccess extension may be excluded.

For a certificate issued to “Good CA”, some examples of URIs that may appear as the access location in an subjectInfoAccess extension when the id-ad-caRepository access method is used are:

http://www.example.com/fictitiousCertsOnlyCMSdirectory/CAcertsIssuedByGoodCA.p7c ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=Good%20CA,c=US?cACertificate,crossCertificatePair;binary

6. PIV-I Certificates 
======================

The certificate profiles for PIV-I are based on the profile for End Entity Signature Certificates, but these profiles differ in a number of ways based on requirements that are specified in the FBCA \[1\]. The main differences in these profiles are as follows:

-   There must be an OCSP server that responds on port 80 that provides certificate status information for PIV-I certificates and the authorityInfoAccess extension in these certificates must include an access method of type id-ad-ocsp where the access location is a URI with a scheme of "http".

-   PIV-I Card Authentication certificates must include a critical extended key usage extension that asserts id-PIV-cardAuth.

-   Authentication certificates and PIV-I Card Authentication certificates must include a subjectAltName extension that includes the UUID from the PIV-I card that holds the certificates.

-   The subjectAltName extension in the PIV-I Card Authentication certificates must not include any name forms other than the UUID.

-   The nonRepudiation key usage bit must not be set in either PIV-I Authentication or PIV-I Card Authentication certificates.

-   PIV-I Content Signing certificates that are used to verify signatures on the CHUID or biometric data on PIV-I cards include an extended key usage extension that asserts id-fpki-pivi-content-signing.

1. Worksheet Contents 
======================

The certificate and CRL profiles consist of nine worksheets. Each worksheet lists mandatory contents of a particular class of certificates or CRLs. Optional features that will be widely supported in the Federal PKI are also identified. These features MAY be included at the issuer's option. Certificate and CRL issuers may include additional information in non-critical extensions for local use, but should not expect clients in the Federal PKI to process this additional information. Critical extensions that are not listed in these worksheets MUST NOT be included in certificates or CRLs issued for PIV-I.

The nine worksheets are:

1.  The *Self-Issued CA Certificate Profile* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of key rollover certificates.

2.  The *Cross Certificate* *Profile* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates issued by CAs for PIV-I where the subject is another CA and the public key will be used to verify the signature on certificates and CRLs.

3.  The *CRL Profile* worksheet table defines the mandatory and optional contents of CRLs issued by CAs that issue certificates for PIV-I.

4.  The *PIV-I Card Authentication Certificate Profile* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates that correspond to the Card Authentication Key defined in Section 4.3 of FIPS 201.

5.  The *PIV-I Authentication Certificate Profile* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates that correspond to the PIV Authentication Key defined in Section 4.3 of FIPS 201.

6.  The *PIV-I Digital Signature Certificate Profile* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates that correspond to the Digital Signature Key defined in Section 4.3 of FIPS 201.

7.  The *PIV-I* *Key Management Certificate Profile* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates that correspond to the Key Management Key defined in Section 4.3 of FIPS 201.

8.  The *PIV-I Content Signing Certificate Profile* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates issued by CAs to Card Management Systems for use in signing data objects on the PIV-I card.

9.  The *Delegated OCSP Responder* *Certificate Profile* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates issued to OCSP responders that are delegated to provide certificate revocation status.

| **authorityInfoAccess **     | FALSE                 |                      | authorityInfoAccess consists of a sequence of accessMethod and accessLocation pairs. Two access methods are defined: one for locating certificates issued to the certificate issuer and one for locating an OCSP server that provides status information about this certificate. Certificates issued for PIV-I must include an authorityInfoAccess extension with at least one instance of the caIssuers access method that specifies an HTTP URI. The OCSP access method must also be included since the FBCA mandates OCSP distribution of status information for this certificate.                                                                     |

| **authorityInfoAccess **     | FALSE                 |                      | authorityInfoAccess consists of a sequence of accessMethod and accessLocation pairs. Two access methods are defined: one for locating certificates issued to the certificate issuer and one for locating an OCSP server that provides status information about this certificate. Certificates issued for PIV-I must include an authorityInfoAccess extension with at least one instance of the caIssuers access method that specifies an HTTP URI. The OCSP access method must also be included since the FBCA mandates OCSP distribution of status information for this certificate.                                    |

| **authorityInfoAccess **    | FALSE                 |                         | authorityInfoAccess consists of a sequence of accessMethod and accessLocation pairs.

Certificates issued for PIV-I must include an authorityInfoAccess extension with at least one instance of the caIssuers access method that specifies an HTTP URI. The OCSP access method must also be included since the FBCA mandates OCSP distribution of status information for this certificate.                                                                                        |

The OCSP access method must also be included since the FBCA mandates OCSP distribution of status information for this certificate.                                                                                 |

| **authorityInfoAccess **     | FALSE |                      | authorityInfoAccess consists of a sequence of accessMethod and accessLocation pairs. Two access methods are defined: one for locating certificates issued to the certificate issuer and one for locating an OCSP server that provides status information about this certificate. Certificates issued for PIV-I must include an authorityInfoAccess extension with at least one instance of the caIssuers access method that specifies an HTTP URI. The OCSP access method must also be included since the FBCA mandates OCSP distribution of status information for this certificate.                                                  |
