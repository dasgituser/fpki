| March 9, 2004      | 1.0            | Initial version of profile                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| July 8, 2004       | 1.1            | 1.  The dual-use certificate profile for human end users has been removed in order to align with Common Certificate Policy.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                       2.  The section on URIs now recommends the use of a single LDAP URI that specifies multiple attributes rather than use of multiple LPAP URIs in the authorityInfoAccess and subjectInfoAccess extensions.     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                       3.  The section on URIs now indicates that the subjectInfoAccess extension may be omitted from CA certificates if the certificate subject does not issue CA certificates.                                     |
| January 19, 2006   | 1.2            | Added certificate profiles for Card Authentication Certificates and PIV Authentication Certificates as specified in FIPS 201 and aligned algorithms with NIST SP 800-78.                                     |
| February 6, 2006   | 1.3            | Modified the PIV Authentication Certificate Profile in Worksheet 9 to reflect that these certificates cannot assert id-fpki-common-hardware in the certificatePolicies extension.                            |
| March 9, 2006      | 1.4            | Added id-pki-common-cardAuth to the list of policy OIDs that may be asserted in CA certificates (worksheets 2 and 3).                                                                                        |

Introduction 
=============

> This document specifies the X.509 version 3 certificate and version 2 certificate revocation list (CRL) profiles for certificates and CRLs issued under the X.509 Certificate Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework \[1\]. The profiles serve to identify unique parameter settings for certificates and CRLs issued under this policy.
>
> In the interest of establishing commonality and interoperability among PKI communities outside the Federal government, it was decided that this profile should be based on a
>
> “standard PKI profile” but still contain the unique parameter settings for Federal systems.
>
> The only widely accepted PKI profile currently on track to become a standard is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) profile developed by the PKIX working group \[3\]. The PKIX profile identifies the format and semantics of certificates and CRLs for the Internet PKI. Procedures are described for processing and validating certification paths in the Internet environment. Encoding rules are provided for all fields and extensions profiled in both the X.509 v3 certificate and v2 CRL. Encoding rules for cryptographic algorithms specified in this profile are specified in \[7\], \[10\], and \[14\].

Structure 
----------

> This document is divided into six sections. Section 1 includes this introduction. Sections 2 and 3 describe the v3 certificate and v2 CRL respectively. These sections specifically describe the differences in generation and processing requirements between the PKIX profile and the profile for certificates and CRLs issued under the Common Certificate Policy. Unless otherwise noted in this profile, the reader should follow the PKIX generation and processing requirements for a particular field. Section 4 specifies rules for choosing character encoding sets for attribute values of type DirectoryString in distinguished names. Section 5 profiles the use of uniform resource identifiers (URIs) in certificates. Section 6 highlights certificate contents that are particular to PIV. Section 7 provides an overview of each of the certificate and CRL profiles included in the worksheets corresponding to this document.

X.509 v3 Certificates 
======================

> X.509 v3 certificates contain the identity and attribute data of a subject using the base certificate with applicable extensions. The base certificate contains such information as the version number of the certificate, the certificate’s identifying serial number, the signature algorithm used to sign the certificate, the issuer’s distinguished name, the validity period of the certificate, the distinguished name of the subject, and information about the subject’s public key. To this base certificate are appended numerous certificate extensions. More detailed information about X.509 certificates can be found in Recommendation X.509 and RFC 5280.
>
> CAs create certificates for user authentication procedures that require one user to obtain another user’s public key. So that users trust the public key, the CA employs a digital signature to cryptographically sign the certificate in order to provide assurance that the information within the certificate is correct. The fields in a certificate identify the issuer (i.e., CA), subject (i.e., user), version number, subject’s public key, validity period, and serial number of the certificate along with the public key algorithm used to certify the certificate. A CA may also add certificate extensions containing additional information about the user or the CA, depending on the implementation.
>
> All certification paths start from a trust anchor. A trust anchor is a CA that a user trusts to issue certificates based on out-of-band knowledge. The public key of a trust anchor is distributed to certificate users in the form of a “trust anchor certificate.” A trust anchor certificate:

-   is self-signed, that is, signed with the private key corresponding to the public key contained in the subject public key field of the certificate;[1]

-   contains any needed parameters in the subject public key info field, where the digital signature algorithm used in the certificate requires the use of parameters;

-   contains few or no extensions;

-   is kept in protected memory or otherwise protected from alteration by an intruder;

-   is transferred to the application or certificate using system in an authenticated manner. The signature on the trust anchor certificate cannot authenticate the certificate.

> There is no single trust anchor for the entire Federal Government. The trust anchor used by a certificate using application may be the CA that issued it a certificate or may be a CA that is at the top of a hierarchy of CAs. Which trust anchors may be used by agency certificate using systems to start certification paths is a matter of agency security policy.
>
> Agencies will designate the CAs that may be used as trust anchors by certificate using systems within the agency, and will establish the approved mechanisms for obtaining the trust anchors' public keys in a secure, authenticated manner. The FPKI Management Authority will make the self-signed certificate of the Common Certificate Policy Root CA available for use as a trust anchor, and it is expected that this CA will be used as the trust anchor for most users who are issued certificates under the Common Certificate Policy.
>
> V3 certificates provide a mechanism for CAs to append additional information about the subject’s public key, issuer’s public key, and issuer’s CRLs. Standard certificate extensions are defined for X.509 v3 certificates. These extensions provide methods of increasing the amount of information the X.509 certificate conveys to facilitate automated certificate processing.

X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists 
======================================

> CAs use CRLs to publicize the revocation of a subject’s certificate. The CRLs are stored in the directory as attributes and are checked by relying parties to verify that a user’s certificate has not been revoked. The fields in a CRL identify the issuer, the date the current CRL was generated, the date by which the next CRL will be generated, and the revoked users’ certificates.

CAs may optionally issue additional CRLs, such as delta-CRLs, so long as complete for scope CRLs are also made available and are issued with sufficient frequency to meet the requirements specified in Section 4.9.7 of the Common Certificate Policy. CAs that issue segmented CRLs are strongly encouraged to also issue full CRLs in order to accommodate third parties that use CRLs to generate

If an OCSP server is available that provides status information about a certificate, then the authorityInfoAccess extension for that certificate should include a pointer to the OCSP server.

Encoding Distinguished Names with Attributes of type DirectoryString 
=====================================================================

> X.509 certificates and CRLs include distinguished names to identify issuers (of certificates and CRLs), subjects of certificates, and to specify CRL distribution points.
>
> Many of the attributes in distinguished names use the DirectoryString syntax.
>
> DirectoryString permits encoding of names in a choice of character sets: PrintableString, TeletexString, BMPString, UniversalString, and UTF8String.
>
> PrintableString is currently the most widely used encoding for attribute values in distinguished names. PrintableString is a subset of ASCII; it does not include characters required for most international languages. UTF8String is an encoding that supports all recognized written languages, including some ancient languages (e.g., Runic). Any name that can be represented in PrintableString can also be encoded using UTF8String.
>
> Name comparison is an important step in X.509 path validation, particularly for name chaining and name constraints computation. Many legacy implementations are unable to perform name comparisons when names are encoded using different character sets. To simplify correct operation of path validation, CAs are strongly encouraged to honor the subject’s chosen character set when issuing CA certificates or populating extensions. That is, if a subject CA encodes its own name in the issuer field of certificates and CRLs it generates using TeletexString, the cross certificate should use the same character set to specify that CA’s name.
>
> Name constraints are specified in CA certificates. The names specified in name constraints must be compared with the subject names in subsequent certificates in a certification path. To help ensure that name constraints are applied correctly, CAs should encode each attribute value in a name constraint using the same encoding as is used to encode the corresponding attribute value in subject names in subsequent certificates. In general, it may be assumed that subject names are encoded in the same way as the issuer field in the certificates issued by the subject of the certificate containing the name constraints extension.
>
> For certificates and CRLs issued under the Common Certificate Policy, attributes of type DirectoryString in the issuer fields of certificates and CRLs and the distributionPoint fields of cRLDistributionPoints and issuingDistributionPoint extensions shall be encoded in PrintableString. In the subject field of end entity certificates, all attributes of type DirectoryString, except the common name attribute type, shall be encoded in PrintableString. The common name attribute type in the subject field of end entity certificates shall be encoded in PrintableString if it is possible to encode the certificate subject's name using that encoding. If the certificate subject's name cannot be encoded using PrintableString, then UTF8String shall be used. The subject name in CA certificates shall be encoded exactly as it is encoded in the issuer field of certificates and CRLs

Use of URIs in Distribution Points, AuthorityInfoAccess, and subjectInfoAccess Extensions 
==========================================================================================

> Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are used in four different extensions within the certificate and CRL profiles in this document: authorityInfoAccess, subjectInfoAccess, cRLDistributionPoints, and issuingDistributionPoint. Two different protocols are used in this document: LDAP and HTTP. The specifications for URIs for these protocols may be found in RFC 4516 and RFC 2616, respectively.
>
> Except for the id-ad-ocsp access method of the authorityInfoAccess extension, the scheme portion of all URIs must be either "ldap" or "http" to indicate that the relevant information is located in an LDAP accessible directory or via HTTP. For the id-ad-ocsp access method of the authorityInfoAccess, the scheme portion of the URI must be "http" to indicate that the transport protocol for the OCSP request/response messages is HTTP. The hostname of every URI must be specified as either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address. The information must be made available via the default port number for the relevant protocol (80 for HTTP and 389 for LDAP) and so does not need to be specified in the URI.
>
> In the cRLDistributionPoints extension, the URI is a pointer to a current CRL that provides status information about the certificate. If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN of the entry containing the CRL and specify the directory attribute in which the CRL is located (certificateRevocationList, authorityRevocationList, or deltaRevocationList). If the directory in which the CRL is stored expects the "binary" option to be specified, then the attribute type must be followed by ";binary" in the URI. If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file that has an extension of ".crl" that contains the DER encoded CRL (see RFC 2585). When a URI is used as the DistributionPointName in the issuingDistributionPoint extension in a CRL, the value must match the URI in the corresponding distribution points in the cRLDistributionPoints extensions in certificates covered by the CRL.
>
> Some examples of URIs that may appear in a cRLDistributionPoints or issuingDistributionPoint extension are: ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=Good%20CA,o=Test%20Certificates,c=US?certificateRevocationList

> ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=onlyContainsCACerts%20CA,o=Test%20Certs,c=US?authorityRevocationList;binary http://www.example.com/fictitiousCRLdirectory/fictitiousCRL1.crl
>
> The authorityInfoAccess extension uses URIs for two purposes. When the id-ad-caIssuers access method is used, the access location specifies where certificates issued to the issuer of the certificate may be found. If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN of the entry containing the relevant certificates and specify the directory attribute in which the certificates are located. If the directory in which the certificates are stored expects the "binary" option to be specified, then the attribute type must be followed by ";binary" in the URI. If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file that has an extension of ".p7c" that
>
> contains a certs-only CMS message (see RFC 5751). The CMS message should include all certificates issued to the issuer of this certificate, but must at least contain all certificates issued to the issuer of this certificate in which the subject public key may be used to verify the signature on this certificate.
>
> Certificates issued under the Common Certificate Policy must include an authorityInfoAccess extension that contains at least one instance of the id-ad-caIssuers access method. The access locations for these instances must be either (1) an HTTP URI or (2) an LDAP URI that specifies both the cACertificate and crossCertificatePair attributes (a CA may, alternatively, specify each of the attributes in a separate LDAP URI).
>
> For a certificate issued by “Good CA”, some examples of URIs that may appear as the access location in an authorityInfoAccess extension when the id-ad-caIssuers access method is used are: ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=Good%20CA,o=Test%20Certificates,c=US?cACertificate,crossCertificatePair ldap:// ldap.example.com/cn=Good%20CA,o=Test%20Certs,c=US?cACertificate;binary,crossCertificatePair;binary http://www.example.com/fictitiousCertsOnlyCMSdirectory/certsIssuedToGoodCA.p7c
>
> When the id-ad-ocsp access method is used, the access location specifies the location of an OCSP server that provides status information about the certificate. The URI may include a path. Where privacy is a requirement, the URI may specify the "https" scheme to indicate that the transport protocol for OCSP requests/responses is HTTP over SSL/TLS. In this case, the default port number is 443, and the URI must include the server's port number if this default port number is not used.
>
> The id-ad-caRepository access method for the subjectInfoAccess extension uses URIs to specify the location where CA certificates issued by the subject of the certificate may be found. If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN of the entry containing the relevant certificates and specify the directory attribute in which the certificates are located. If the directory in which the certificates are stored expects the "binary" option to be specified, then the attribute type must be followed by ";binary" in the URI. If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file that has an extension of ".p7c" that contain a certs-only CMS message (see RFC 5751). The CMS message should include all CA certificates issued by the subject of this certificate, but must at least contain all CA certificates issued by the subject of this certificate in which the signature on the certificate may be verified using the subject public key in this certificate.
>
> CA certificates issued under the Common Certificate Policy should include a subjectInfoAccess extension that contains at least one instance of the id-ad-caRepository access method. The access locations in this extension should be either (1) an HTTP URI or (2) an LDAP URI that specifies both the cACertificate and crossCertificatePair attributes (a CA may, alternatively, specify each of the attributes in a separate LDAP URI). If the subject of the certificate only issues end entity certificates, then the subjectInfoAccess extension may be excluded. If the subject of the certificate issues selfissued certificates (e.g., key rollover certificates), but does not issue certificates to other CAs, then the LDAP URI in the subjectInfoAccess extension only needs to specify the cACertificate attribute.

PIV Certificates 
=================

> The certificate profiles for the PIV Authentication and Card Authentication certificates are based on the profile for End Entity Signature Certificates, but these profiles differ in a number of ways based on requirements that are specified in FIPS 201 \[11\]. The main differences in these profiles are as follows:

-   There must be an OCSP server that responds on port 80 that provides certificate status information for PIV Authentication certificates and Card Authentication certificates and the authorityInfoAccess extension in these certificates must include an access method of type id-ad-ocsp where the access location is a URI with a scheme of "http".

-   PIV Authentication certificates must assert the id-fpki-common-authentication policy OID.

-   Card Authentication certificates must assert the id-fpki-common-cardAuth policy OID and must include a critical extended key usage extension that asserts id-PIV-cardAuth.

-   The inclusion of a non-NULL subject name in Card Authentication certificates is optional.

-   Both PIV Authentication certificates and Card Authentication certificates must include a subjectAltName extension that includes the FASC-N from the PIV Card that holds the certificates. For certificates issued after October 15, 2015, the subjectAltName extension in the Card Authentication certificates must also include a UUID, but must not include any other name forms. The subjectAltName extension in PIV Authentication certificates may contain any name forms in addition to the FASC-N and UUID that are required by the various applications with which the certificate will be used.

-   The nonRepudiation key usage bit must not be set in PIV Authentication certificates, Common Derived PIV Authentication certificates, or Card Authentication certificates.

-   PIV Authentication certificates, Common Derived PIV Authentication certificates, and Card Authentication certificates must include a piv-interim extension that indicates whether the certificate subject's NACI had been completed and successfully adjudicated at the time of certificate issuance.

> FIPS 201 also requires that certificates that can be used to verify signatures on the CHUID or biometric data on PIV Cards include an extended key usage extension that asserts id-PIV-content-signing. After October 15, 2015 the id-PIV-content-signing EKU can only be asserted in Common PIV ContentSigning certificates (i.e. the certificate must assert the id-fpki-common-piv-contentSigning certificate policy)

Worksheet Contents 
===================

> The certificate and CRL profiles consist of twelve worksheets. Each worksheet lists mandatory contents of a particular class of certificates or CRLs. Optional features that will be widely supported in the Federal PKI are also identified. These features MAY be included at the issuer's option. Certificate and CRL issuers may include additional information in non-critical extensions for local use, but should not expect clients in the Federal PKI to process this additional information. Critical extensions that are not listed in these worksheets MUST NOT be included in certificates or CRLs issued under the Common Certificate Policy.
>
> The twelve worksheets are:

1.  The *Self-Signed Certificates* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of self-signed CA certificates issued by CAs for use by PKI client systems when establishing trust anchors.

2.  The *Self-Issued CA Certificates* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of key rollover certificates.

3.  The *Cross-Certificates* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates issued by CAs under the Common Certificate Policy where the subject is another CA and the public key will be used to verify the signature on certificates and CRLs.

4.  The *CRL* worksheet table defines the mandatory and optional contents of CRLs issued by CAs that issue certificates under the Common Certificate Policy.

5.  The *End Entity Signature Certificates* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates issued by CAs to Federal employees and contractors where the public key will be used to verify the signatures.

6.  The *Key Management Certificates* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates issued by CAs to Federal employees and contractors where the public key will be used to perform key management operations.

7.  The *Certificates for Computing and Communications Devices* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates issued by CAs to computing or communications devices (e.g., routers, firewalls, servers, etc.).

8.  The *Card Authentication Certificates* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates that correspond to the Card Authentication Key defined in Section 4.2.2 of FIPS 201.

9.  The *PIV Authentication Certificates* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates that correspond to the PIV Authentication Key defined in Section 4.2.2 of FIPS 201.

10. The *PIV Content Signing Certificate* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates that correspond to the Common PIV Content Signing key defined in Section 4.2.1 of FIPS 201.

11. The Common *Derived PIV Authentication Certificates* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates that correspond to the Derived PIV Authentication Key defined in Section 4.2.2 of FIPS 201.

12. The *Delegated OCSP Responders* worksheet defines the mandatory and optional contents of certificates issued to OCSP responders.
